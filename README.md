# event_manager
This project's purpose is to make an event manager that parses a CSV dataset to create campaign thank-you letters using Ruby, ERB, and [Google's Civic Information API](https://developers.google.com/civic-information/).
In addition to creating campaign letters based off a template, the program also contains several other methods to determine the most common time(s) and day(s) of the week that users registered, allowing for more effective marketing campaigns.

This project was created as an exercise for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-event-manager).
